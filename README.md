Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Software Developer in the process. CSS and JavaScript are my favourite things in the world and I love making cool projects from scratch. I started my journey as a self-taugh developer through Codecademy, Code First Girls and the 100Devs Bootcamp whilst working full time. Let me say it has not been easy but I would not have it any other way, as the skills you learn along the way are very hard to pick up through different paths. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for the CFG Web Development course.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning intermediate JavaScript and the Git command line. 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m happy to collaborate on CSS projects (I'm a HUGE Flexbox lover!).
ðŸ“« How to reach me: I will be setting up a twitter and insta account soon...
âš¡ Fun fact: I am a full time Primary School Teacher!
